# Earthquake_magnitude_estimation

The goal of this project was the estimation of the magnitude of the earthquakes through preprocessing and machine learning tecniques given some extracted features from the seismic catalogue and the seismic traces. 

[earthquake magnitude estimation2.ipynb](https://github.com/Iron486/Earthquake_magnitude_estimation/blob/main/earthquake_magnitude_estimation2.ipynb) and
 [earthquake magnitude estimation.ipynb](https://github.com/Iron486/Earthquake_magnitude_estimation/blob/main/earthquake_magnitude_estimation.ipynb) are the notebooks 
that brought to the obtained main results for earthquake magnitude estimation. 

The first one was gotten considering the features extracted with all the stations,
the second one is the model obtained with one station (the station that starts with letter `r`).
The waveforms, the stations and the catalogue with all the events were provided and they were loaded and processed in the notebook.
