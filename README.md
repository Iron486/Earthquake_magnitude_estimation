# Earthquake_magnitude_estimation
"Earthquake magnitude estimation" and "earthquake magnitude estimation2" are the notebooks 
that brought to the main results obtained for earthquake magnitude estimation. 

The first one was the model obtained with one station (the station that starts with letter r),
the second one was obtained considering the features extracted with all the stations.
Waveforms, stations and the catalogue with all the events were provided and were read in the notebook.
